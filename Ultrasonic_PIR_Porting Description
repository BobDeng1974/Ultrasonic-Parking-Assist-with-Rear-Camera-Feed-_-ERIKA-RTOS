This file lists description of Task 1.

The task objective was to port ERIKA OS to Arduino UNO and build a simple blinking LED application.
Then, a more complex application was to be built, so both PIR and Ultrasonic sensors have been interfaced
with the board using the simplified Arduino C. The external library of the ultrasonic sensor couldn't be
imported successfully so the necessary functions were written from scratch.
